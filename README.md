# Decision-Maker
#### Initiated and implemented a web application, named Decision Maker, which would predict the number of students who would select a particular subject, when given choices. It has been observed that students wait till end, to know which subject majority of students are choosing. Since, the students would get to know about majority voting beforehand, the students can make a proper decision earlier.

> Our college gives us freedom to select one subject of our choice. This subject is called Elective. We are given options of 6 subjects, and we have to rate these subjects in order of preference. 

**Important Features:**
* This project is implemented using Django Framework.
* The dataset was formed by extracting data, after every 12 hours
* Simple Linear Regression Algorithm was implemented for data mining.
* Used inbuilt scikit-learn package to implement Simple Linear Regression
* matplotlib was used for plotting graphs.
